Pokemon Team Builder

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, Axios

Features/How it works
    Scroll through list of pokemon
    Click on whatever one that you want
    Pokemon card will pop up
    Look over stats/typing and decide if you want to add it to your team
    Click add to team button if you want it
    Or just scroll though the pokemon list again if you don't
    You can click the show team button whenever you want to see your current team
    If you decide there is a pokemon you don't want on your team you can click the x next to their picture to remove them from your team
    You can only have 6 pokemon on your team so if you try to add more than that an alert will pop up telling you to delete a pokemon from your team before you can add another
